# VRC-Song-Lyrics

really work in progess still have lots to do however its currently semi-fuctinal, besides pausing and unpausing songs(the thread isnt closing for some reason), skiping to different parts of songs(i think although it may be ok) and some other things that will surely not work. mostly writing this here so i can get a clearer idea of what needs done.

### Todo:
- [ ] make it so you can pause and upause without weridness(hopefully almost done need to fix a thread still running tho) :tada:
- [ ] use window title for seeing if song name changed(get song title with window handle), then make spotify current track requ so im not spamming api like crazy
- [ ] make it write the song to your status
- [ ] uh some other stuff prob
